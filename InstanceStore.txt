Instance Store:
 - Referred to as Ephemeral Storage
 - Restricted Instance Types
 - May be attached only at time of EC2 creation, not additional storage
 - Instance stores cannot be stopped, only rebooted or terminated
 - Less durability
 - Precursor to EBS
 - Can be detached/reattached on the fly, even with EC2 running
 - Root device AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in S3
 - If the hosts fails, all data is lost
 - Root volumes are deleted on termination
