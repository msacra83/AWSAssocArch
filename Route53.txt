Routing Policies:
  - Simple Routing
    - Only allowed 1 record with multiple IP addresses
    - Multiple IPs returns all values in a random order
  - Weighted Routed
    - Sends disproportionate amount off traffic to different IP addresses, split traffic on different weights assigned
    - E.g. 20% go to us-east-1, 80% go to us-west-1
    - Weight is whole number that repersents requests out of total of whole numbers
  - Latency-based Routing
    - Allows traffic based on the lowest network latency for the end user
  - Failover Routing
  - Geolocation Routing
  - Multivalue Answer Routing
