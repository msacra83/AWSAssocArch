Route53 name comes from Route 66 variant on port 53

SOA: 
 - Name of the server that supplied data for the zone
 - Admin of zon
 - Current version of the data file
 - TTL

NS:
 - Name server records
 - Used by TLD servers to direct to content DNS

A Record:
 - Most fundamental type of DNS
 - A stands for address
 - Cant mix and match except for small exceptions

Difference in CNAME and Alias:
  - CNAME cannot be used for naked domain names such as sacra.com, only FQDN such as mail.sacra.com.  Useful when pointing to ELBs and S3 buckets

Routing Policies:
  - Simple Routing
    - Only allowed 1 record with multiple IP addresses
    - Multiple IPs returns all values in a random order
  - Weighted Routed
    - Sends disproportionate amount off traffic to different IP addresses, split traffic on different weights assigned
    - E.g. 20% go to us-east-1, 80% go to us-west-1
    - Weight is whole number that repersents requests out of total of whole numbers
  - Latency-based Routing
    - Allows traffic based on the lowest network latency for the end user
  - Failover Routing
    - Used to create active/passive setup
    - E.g. Primary site eu-east-1 and Secondary DR us-west-2
    - Route 53 will monitor the health of the primary site using a health check
    - Monitors health of end points
    - Lowering TTL allows for faster failover
  - Geolocation Routing
    - Choose where traffic will be sent based on location of end users
  - Multivalue Answer Routing
    - Allows multiple IP addresses
    - Can be autoremoved pending healthchecks
    - Randomly distribute IPs
    - Can allocate 1 record for each resource

Healthchecks can monitor:
  - Endpoints
  - Status of other health checks
  - State of CloudWatch alarm
  - Takes some time for the status to come online
