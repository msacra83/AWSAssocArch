Virtual Private Cloud (Datacenter)

Allows an isolated section of the cloud.  You have complete control over virual network.

You are able to connect hardware vpns to vpcs

External connections:
  - Internet Gateway
  - VPN

Security Groups can span subnets

Softlimit of 5 VPCs per region

Launch instances into subnet of choosing

Configure route tables between subnets

Create Internet Gateways, only allowed 1 IG per VPC

Default VPC
  - User friendly, allows you to immediately deploy instances
  - No private subnets in default VPCs
  - Each EC2 instance will have public/private IP address

VPC Peering
  - Connect one VPC to another using a direct network route with private IP
  - Instances behave as if they are on the same private netowrk
  - You can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts
  - 1 Central VPC with 4 others
  - NO TRANSITIVE PEERING

1 Subnet = 1 AZ

Security groups are Stateful, NACLs are stateless

Dedicated Tenancy is on dedicated hardware

Creating a new VPC will create route, IG, NACL, SG, Will not create Subnet

5 IP Addresses of subnet will always be reserved (First 4 and last):
  - Network Address (1st)
  - Reserved by AWS by VPC Router (2nd)
  - Reserved by AWS for DNS (3rd)
  - Reserved by AWS for future use (4th)
  - Broadcast (last)

All subnets by default are associated with the main route table

2 Subnets must be specified for ELBs

Flow Logs:
  - Allows you to capture info about IP traffic to your VPC
  - Stored in CloudWatch
  - Able to be created at 3 levels:
    - VPC
      - Capture all traffic within VPC
    - Subnet
      - Capture all traffic in subnet
    - Network Interface
  - You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs peered with your account, unless the peer VPC is in your account
  - Cannot be tagged
  - Once created, you cannot change the configuration
  - Not all traffic is monitored (e.g. DNS, windows license activation, DHCP, 169.254.169.254)

NAT instances always behind security group, NAT gateways are security group independent
NAT gateways, AWS autopatches, and have HA

Bastion HA:
  - Multiple subnets (at least 2 public)
  - Autoscaling

NAT is used to provide traffic to EC2s in private subnets
Bastion is used to securly admin servers

Endpoints:
  - Internal gateway within AWS
  - Source IPs will be private IPs

Parts of VPC:
  - Routing tables
  - NACLs
  - Security groups
  - Internet Gateways
  - Subnets
  - VPN attachments
  - VPC Peering connections
  - Network Interfaces

NAT Instances:
  - Disable source/destination check on the instance
  - Must be in public subnet
  - Must have route out of private subnet to the NAT instance
  - Amount of traffic NAT instance can support depends on instance size
  - Create HA using autoscaling groups, multiple subnets in different AZs. script to automate failover
  - Behind security group

NAT Gateways:
  - Enterprise
  - Scale up automatically to 10Gbps
  - No need to patch
  - Not associated with security groups
  - Auto assigned a public ip
  - Update route tables
  - No need to disable source/destination check
  - More secure
