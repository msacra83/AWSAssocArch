Cloudwatch:
  - Dashboards
  - Alarms
  - Events
  - Logs

Understand default metrics
Know what metrics are available by default for EC2 Instance
  - CPU
  - Disk
  - Network
  - Status

RAM is not available by default, will require a custom metric

Events respond to state changes in AWS Resources 
  - E.g. Automatically run lambda to update route53 when EC2 is in running state

Logs allow you to monitor events at the application level

Standard monitoring = 5 Min
Detailed monitoring = 1 Min
