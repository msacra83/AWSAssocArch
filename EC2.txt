**For Exam:
Termination protection is off by default
Default action for root EBS is to be deleted on termination
Encryption on DEFAULT AMIs root volumes is unavailable
Additional volumes can be encrypted on any AMI
1 subnet = 1 AZ, subnets cannot expand across multiple AZs
EBS Backed volumes are persistent
Instance store are not persistent (ephemeral)

System status check - underlying hypervisor
Instance status check - checks getting traffic to OS

Default root device cannot be encrypted
Key pairs do not propagate across regions
