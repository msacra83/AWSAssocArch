Business Benefits:
  - Almost zero upfront infrastructure investment
  - Just-in-time Infrastructure
  - Effecient resource utilization
  - Usage-based costing
  - Reduced time to Market

Technical Benefits:
  - IaC
  - Auto-Scaling
  - Proactive Scaling
  - Effecient dev lifecycle
  - Improved Testability
  - DR and business continuity
  - Overflow traffic to the cloud

Design for Failure:
  - Be a pessimist when designing architecture 

Decouple your components (SQS = decoupling)
  - not have tight dependencies on each other
  - loose coupling isolates various layers 
  - On batch processing, you can create asynchronous components

Impliment Elasticity:
  - Proactive cyclic Scaling, occurs at fixed intervals
  - Proactive event scaling, occurs during e.g. new product launch in anticipation of event
  - Auto-scaling, based on demand

Secure your application:
  - Only allow necessary ports
 
General Design Principles:
  - Stop guess capacity
  - Test at prod scale
  - Automate
  - Allow evolutionary architectures
  - Data-Driven architectures
  - Improve through game days
