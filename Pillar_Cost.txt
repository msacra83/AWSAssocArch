  - Transparently attribute expenditure
  - Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership
  - Trade capital expense for operating expense
  - Benefit from economies of scale
  - Stop spending money on DC operations

Definition:
  - Match supply and demand
    - How do you make sure your capacity matches but doesnt exceed what you need?
    - How are you optimizing your usage of AWS Services?
  - Cost effective resources
    - Have you selected the appropriate resource types to meet your cost targets?
    - Have you selected the appropriate pricing model to meet your cost targets?
    - Are there managed services that you can use to improve your ROI?
  - Expenditure awareness
    - What access controls and procedures do you have in place to govern AWS costs?
    - How are you monitoring usage and spending?
    - How do you decomission resources that you no longer need, or stop resources that are temporarily not needed?
    - How do you consider data transfer charges when designing your architecture?
  - Optimizing over time
    - How do you manage/consider adoption of new services?
