**You can only have a subnet to 1 NACL, not multiple

By default, when you create private NACL, everything is DENY/DENY on egress and ingress

Start at rule 100, and increase in increments of 100

Add ports 1024-65535 for outgoing connections (ephemeral ports)

Rules are evaluated in numerical order

NACL rules are applied immediately, if ALL ALLOW is 100, and DENY 192.168.11.11 is 101, 192.168.11.11 is allowed.
If DENY 192.168.11.11 is 100, then ALL ALLOW is 101, 192.168.11.11 is blocked

Each subnet in VPC must be associated with NACL, if you havent explicitly associated a subnet with a NACL, the subnet is automatically added to the default NACL.

You can associate a NACL with multiple subnets, but subnets can only be associated with one NACL.  When you associate a NACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.

Assessed before SGs

SGs cannot block specific ips
