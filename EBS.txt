  - Lowest cost
  - infrequently accessed
  - file server
  - Cannot be boot volume
- Magnetic (Standard)
  - Lowest cost per GB that is bootable
  - Legacy

EBS must be in same AZ as EC2
No downtime when modifying volume
You cannot modify a standard volume (Magnetic)

How to create another ec2/ebs in another AZ:
1. Take snapshot of EBS
2. Create volume from snapshot in another A/Region:
or
1. Copy snapshot to another region
2. Create image of snapshot (AMI)

Snapshot -> backups
Images -> AMIs

Images -> AMIs

AMIs can be copied to different regions

Only root devices terminated by default

Snapshots exist on S3, but you cannot see the snapshot bucket
Snapshots are incremental
To create root device snapshots, best practice is to stop the ec2, but not required
AMIs can be created from volumes and snapshots
EBS sizes and types can change on the fly
Snapshots of encrypted volumes automatically encrypted, as are volumes restored from encrypted snapshots
Encrypted snapshots may not be shared with other accounts

RAID:
AWS STRONGLY discourages RAID5
Use RAID arrays to increase disk IO
Usually RAID 0 or RAID 10 in AWS

RAID Snapshots:
- Take an application consistent snapshot
  - Stop the application writing to disk
  - Flush all caches to the disk
    - Freeze the file system
    - Unmount the RAID Array
    - Shut down the EC2
