Improves Latency and throughput for read-heavy application workloads or compute intensive workloads

2 engines available:
  - Memcached
    - Widley adopted memory object caching system
    - Protocol compliant with Memcached
  - Redis
    - Open source in-memory key-value store supports data structures (sets and lists)
    - Master/Slave replication in Multi-AZ

For exam:
  - Typically given scenario where DB is under a lot of stress, will ask which service you should use to alleviate
  - Elasticache good choice for read heavy and not prone to change db
  - RedShit is good answer if DB is under stress because management running OLAP
