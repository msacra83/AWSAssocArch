SQS is a web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages

Distrubuted queue system, temporarily stores messages for processing

Autoscaling group could sit behind SQS, and monitor SQS

When message is picked, it is in invisible for timeout period, if it times out, it reappears for another application to grab unless it is marked cleared

Allows you to decouple components of application

Up to 256kb of text in a message, any format

Pull based, not push  based

Messages kept in queue from 1 min to 14 days

Default retention period is 4 days

Queue types:
  - Standard
    - Default
    - High output, but more than one copy may be delivered out of order
    - Uses best-effort ordering to ensure the messages are delivered
    - Nearly unlimited transactions per second
  - FIFO
    - Guarenteed to be delieved in which they arrive
    - Order strictly preserved
    - Duplciates never introduced
    - Limited to 300 transactions per second

  Visibility timeout:
    - Default is 30 seconds
    - Maximum is 12 hours

  Long polling doesnt return a response unless message is in queue unless times out, saves money
