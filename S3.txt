S3 is highly-scalable object storage.  Spread across multiple devices and facilities.

Object based storage -> Files
Block based storage -> operating system or applications

0 bytes to 5TB sized files

Buckets are folders in the cloud
Buckets have universal namespace, folders are unique locally
By default, buckets are private
when uploading file, will receive HTTP 200
Upload much faster by enabling multipart upload

Data Consistency
---------------
Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (Allow time for propagation)

Objects consist of 
- key (name)
- value (data)
- Version ID
- Metadata
- Subresources
  - ACL
  - Torrent

S3 Storage classes:
- S3 Standard:99.99% available 99.9999999999% durability, sustains loss of 2 facilities concurrently, no retrevial fee
- S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed): Lower fee, but charged retrieval fee
- S3 OneZone - IA: (RRS - Reduced Redundancy Storage) Only stored in 1 availability zone, no resilience
  - 99.99% Durability
- Glacier - cheap, only for archival
  - Expedited
  - Standard (3-5 hours to restore)
  - Bulk (5-12 hours to restore) 

S3 charges:
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing (tags)
- Data Transfer Pricing (cross region replication)
- Transfer acceleration

Encryption:
- In Transit
  - SSL/TLS
- Data at rest
  - Client Side Encryption
  - Server Side Encryption
    - S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
      - Per Object
      - AES-256
    - KMS (SSE-KMS)
      - Seperate permissions for Envelop key 
      - Audit trail
    - Customer provided keys (SSE-C)

Versioning:
- Stores all versions of an object, including writes and deletes
- Great for backups
- Cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Integrates with Lifecycle Rules
- MFA Delete/Chaning Available
- For replication, must be enabled on both source and destination

Replication:
- Regions must be unique
- May not replicate to multiple buckets or daisy-chain
- Existing objects not replicated, only new or modified
- To copy files that already exist
  - aws s3 cp --recursive s3://<SOURCE> s3://<DEST>
- Delete markers in versioning is also replicated, but deleting those markers does not replicate
- Reverting in source bucket must be done manually in destination bucket

Lifecycle Rules:
- Allow application to only files with prefix/suffix
- Previous Versions have rules too with versioning turned on
- Transistion to IA, OZ-IA, and Glacier, can also permanently delete

Access to the bucket:
- Bucket Policies
- ACLs
- Logging

Transfer Acceleration:
- Uses uploads through an Edge location
- bucket.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
- Goes over CDN
- Speed Comparison page to give you the best Edge location

Correct URL for static website hosting:
http://<BUCKET_NAME>.s3-website-<AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com
