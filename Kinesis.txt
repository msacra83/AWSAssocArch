Streaming data is generated continuously by thousands of sources, in smaller sizes (eg stock prices)

Kinesis is a platform for loading, analyzing streaming data

Core:
  - Streams
    - Stores by default 24hr, max 7 days
    - Stored in shards
    - 1 shard = 5 transactions/sec for reads, 2MB or 1k record/sec for writes, max total data write of 1MB/sec
    - Producers -> Kinesis Stream -> Consumers -> DB
  - Firehose
    - Analyzes data and/or sends to S3 or other locations
    - No data retention
    - Doesnt have consumers
    - Producers -> Firehose -> DB/S3
    - No Shards!!
    - Auto use Lambda!
  - Analytics
    - Run SQL queries of streaming data
    - Stores results in DB/S3
    - Can use across streams and firehose
