3 Types of ELBs:
  - Application
  - Network
  - Classic

Application ELB:
  - ALB on exam
  - Operate on Layer 7
  - Suited for HTTP/HTTPS
  - Smart ELBs
    - Advanced request routing

Network ELB:
  - NLB on exam
  - Operate on Layer 4
  - Suitable for Extreme performance
  - Low-latency, high volume requests

Classic ELB:
  - ELB on exam
  - Legacy, soon to be depricated
  - Can use Layer 7 some features (X-Forward and sticky sessions)
  - Can use Layer 4 for pure TCP
  - Layer 7 less intelligent than ALB
  
Errors:
 - 504 application stopped responding, ELB is fine
   - Could be server, or DB

X-Forwarded-For Header:
  - Devices behind ELB can see originating IP, but devices IP is NATed
  - Devices get the originating IP from the X-Forwarded-For Header

Health Check Details:
  - Response timeout: time the HC waits for a response from instance
  - Interval: time between health checks
  - Unhealthy threshold: number of consecutive response timeouts before an instance is declared unhealthy
  - Healthy threshold: number of consecutive responses before an instance is placed back in LB

Monitored instances:
  - InService
  - OutOfService

All ELBs have a DNS, IP is not provided
