Automated Backups:
  - Automated Backups
    - Allow recovery from retention period (between 7-35 days)
    - Take full daily snapshot and store transaction logs throughout the day
    - During recovery, AWS will use most recent backup and apply transaction logs
    - This allows a point int time recovery down to the second
    - Enabled by default
    - Stored in S3
    - Free storage space equal to the size of your DB
    - Taken within a defined window
    - During window, storage I/O may be degraded, as well as latency issues
    - Deleted when RDS is deleted
  - Database Snapshots
    - User initiated
    - Stored after RDS is deleted

Restoration:
  - With both Automated and Snapshots, the restored DB will be a new RDS instance with new DNS endpoint

Encryption:
  - At rest is supported for RDS
  - Uses AWS KMS
  - Once DB is encrypted, data stored, backups, read replicas, and snapsots are all encrypted
  - Encrypting an existing DB not currently supported.
  - To encrypt current DB, create snapshot, make a copy, and encrypt the copy

Multi-AZ:
  - Standard Master/Slave
  - Auto fail over between AZ
  - AWS updates DNS in event of failover, never use IPs
  - AWS handles replication
  - FOR DISASTER RECOVERY ONLY!!!!
  - Not for performance
  - Synchronous

Read Replica:
  - Up to 5 read replicas by default
  - Write to primary, read from secondary
  - Could have Read Replicas can be in different AZ or region
  - Read Replicas of Read Replicas are allowed
  - Allow you to have a RO copy of DB
  - Asynchronous
  - Not available for SQL Server or Oracle
  - Used for SCALING, not DR!
  - Automatic backups must be turned on
  - Each Read Replica has its own DNS Endpoint
  - Read Replicas can have Multi-AZ enabled
  - Can create Read Replicas of Multi-AZ source DBs
  - Can be promoted to be their own DBs (breaks replication)
  - Can have encryption enabled, even if primary DB does not use it
