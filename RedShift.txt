RedShift:
  - Petabyte-scale data warehouse

Configuration:
  - Single Node (160G)
  - Mutli-Node
    - Leader Node
      - Manages client connections and receives queries
    - Compute Node
      - Store data and perform queries
      - up to 128 compute nodes

Columnar Data Storage:
  - Instead of storing data in rows, organizes data by column
  - Row based systems optiman for transaction processing
  - Column-based systems ideal for data warehousing and analytics, where queries aggregate over large data sets
  - Columnar is stored sequentially on storage media, far fewer I/O, improves query performance

Advanced Compression:
  - Compressed much more than row based data because similiar data is store sequentially on disk
  - Multiple compression techniques are deployable
  - Doesnt require indexes or materialized vies
  - Uses less disk space than traditional RDS
  - When loading data, Redshift samples data and selects most appropriate compression scheme

Massively Parallel Processing (MPP):
  - Automatically distributes data and query load across all nodes
  - Allows easily adding compute nodes

Pricing:
  - Compute Node Hours, 1 unit per node per hour
  - Not charged for leader, only compute nodes
  - Backup
  - Data transfer within VPC

Security:
  - Encrypted in transit using SSL
  - Encrypted at rest AES-256
  - RedShift takes care of key managment, but can also be done through kms and HSM

Availability:
  - Only available in 1 AZ
  - Can restore snapshots to new AZ's during outage
