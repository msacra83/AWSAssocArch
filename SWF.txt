Allows web applications to be designed as a coordination of tasks
Tasks are invocations of various processing steps (similiar to Cloudwatch events)

SWF Actors:
  - Workflow Starters - an applciation that can initiate a workflow
  - Deciders - Control the flow of activity tasks and decides what to do next
  - Activity Workers - Carry out activity tasks

Workers are programs that work with SWF
  - Gets Task
  - Process received task
  - Return Results

Deciders controls the coordination of tasks

SWF ensures a task is assigned only once, and never duplicated

Difference between SWF and SQS, SWF a task is only assigned once, never duplicated

SQS can have multiple assignments and duplication (depending on settings)

Domains isolate set to types, execution, and tasks lists

Parameters are specified in JSON

Max workflow can be 1 year, measured in seconds

SWF is task orientate api, and can involve human interaction, and can last longer
SQS is message orientated
